The idea of this analysis was to create an automated way to obtain the latest results of the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections and publish them on Twitter. I wanted to create a graph to follow the trend of the vote count so that people could see the evolution of it.

The data were taken from the official Superior Electoral Court of Brazil - Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE). It was a single json file with the last result aggregated, so I had to keep the old data and merge the new ones into a historical dataframe.

The final chart can be seen below.
